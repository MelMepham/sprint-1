Yo mum, whats the command line? I heard its how you learnt how to use a computer!?!

Back when computers were pretty basic, they did not have the processing capacities to have the fancy wizz-dangle icons and fancy buttons, all they had was text, and had to work their way through their computers through moving individually through folders. this is what the command line is.. Basically a computer in its most economical form.

Command line JARGON!
pwd - Print working directories // What folders are you in?
cd - Change directories // change what folder you are in
ls - List directories // List the directories that are in front of you or that you could open from where you are
rm - remove file // delete a file
rmdir - remove directory // delete a folder
rm -r // delete everything within what you are trying to delete
mkdir - Make a new directory // make a new folder
mv - moves something from a to b OR changes a name of something (Does this get me two points??)
-a - opens application
cp - copies a file
git innit - Makes a new repository on github
